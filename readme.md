#  PC (codenamed Baked Bread)
## This is Baked Bread, front facing: PC. PC obviously stands for personal computer. It's a custom computational agent for productivity, with main features being Nudges, Driven, and Snaps.

## Nudges
Nudges are simple notifications that re-direct someone's attention to the nudge's purpose. For example, someone sets a nudge to continue their research paper on most common car maintenance tasks. 

## Driven
Driven is a simple car management and scheduling project baked into your PC. It's custom to your make and model, drawing from catalogs of data for best practices managing your car. Hopefully, I would build hardware to integrate into this feature and your car. Driven will monitor miles, nudge for best practices like oil changing and tire rotation, as well as general software updates if applicable. InDrive would be an Apple CarPlay alternative for those that aren't equipped, deep linking into your car, or just showing relevant information as needed in a Driver-friendly form.

## Snaps
Snaps are rolling notes for conversation and functions of your PC. Snaps are contextual, so when a keyword is used in conversation, PC would reference the note and use it to assist in more relevant responses. Rolling indicates it will be deleted when no longer relevant, (not accessed after a set time period.) 

## Conversation and Functions
The purpose of PC is to automate menial tasks and alleviate cognitive load. I want to promote creativity through a creative app. Its interaction method is natural language, with obvious in-text cards that are relevant to the task being done. Think of a living history of your life, existing in and around what you do, and assisting your daily tasks as a personal assistant should.

## PC Tether
Tether is a paired app to the PC app on your iPhone. Essentially, it will write PC Operations and load them onto your phone. These operations are scripted using a special syntax that I'll develop at some point. This is late stage.

## PC Hardware
I want to use a raspberry pi-custom operating system to deliver deep linking into things like homeassistant, school networks like canvas, and modular machines that can be built with PC operations.
